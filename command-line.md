If I were to explain the command line to my mum in laymans terms I would tell her that it is basically a direct channel to communicate with the computer without the pretty front end buttons and layouts that we see.
Ten commands that I have learnt during this phase are:
1. mkdir - make a directory
2. pwd - identify your current directory
3. ls - list items in a directory
4. cd - navigate paths, folders and directories
5. rm -r - remove a directory
6. touch - make an empty file
7. cp - copy a file
8. mv - move a file
9. cat - view a file
10. rm - remove a file
